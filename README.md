The Placement Prediction Project aims to develop a data-driven model that predicts the likelihood of students securing a job placement based on various factors such as academic performance, extracurricular activities, skills, and demographic information. 
By leveraging historical data and machine learning techniques, the project seeks to provide insights and actionable recommendations for students and educational institutions to enhance placement outcomes.
